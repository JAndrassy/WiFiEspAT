# WiFiEspAT library

This library creates standard Arduino WiFi networking API over ESP8266 AT commands. The Arduino WiFi networking API was established by Arduino WiFi library and enhanced by Arduino WiFi101 and Arduino WiFiNINA library.

This library is fast and reliable. It can communicate with AT firmware at high baud rates without flow control, limited only by reliability of UART at chosen speed. But it doesn't support SSL (https) secure networking for now.

The library is for all Arduino MCU architectures.

## Getting started

* Put AT firmware version 1.7.x into the esp8266 you want to use with the WiFiEspAT library. [ESP8266_AT_LoBo repository](https://github.com/loboris/ESP8266_AT_LoBo) has binaries for all flash sizes. Make sure the firmware is working and returning OK to test command "AT".


* Wire the esp8266 module to Serial1 of your Arduino. Wire RX to TX. If your Arduino doesn't have Serial1, wire the esp8266 modules to pins 6 as RX and 7 as TX for SoftwareSerial.


* If you use SoftwareSerial run the ChangeATBaudRate sketch from WiFiEspAT/Tools section in IDE Examples menu. If the sketch ends with "Communication with WiFi module failed!" check the wiring.


* Run the CheckFirmware sketch from WiFiEspAT/Tools section in IDE Examples menu. If the sketch ends with "Communication with WiFi module failed!" check the wiring.


* Open the SetupPersistentWiFiConnection sketch from WiFiEspAT/Tools section in IDE Examples menu. Set the SSID and password on arduino_secrets tab. Run the sketch to make a persistent connection to your WiFi network.


* Try the Basic examples. Warning: The example sketches are designed to present library functions in a simplest way. They are not examples of a good sketch structure and efficiency. Don't use delays and String in your projects. 


## Why a new WiFiEsp library?

This library uses the new passive receive mode implemented in AT firmware 1.7.0 (SDK 3). The [older WiFiEsp library](https://github.com/bportaluri/WiFiEsp) can't do much with larger data received. Without the passive receive mode, the AT firmware sends all the data at once and the serial RX buffer overflows. It is hard to receive more data over network with AT firmware without UART hardware flow control and Arduino AVR boards don't have flow control and simple esp8266 modules don't have the flow control pins exposed.

Note: The older WiFiEsp library referenced the AT firmware version by SDK version. This library reports AT commands version.


## Limitations

The new passive receive mode of the AT firmware is not supported for UDP and secure connection (SSL) yet. For this reason UDP received message size is limited to configured buffer size and secure connection (SSL, https) is not supported. You can use the older WiFiEsp library for https.

The AT firmware is limited to one TCP server. The AT LoBo customized firmware adds 3 more TCP servers, but without the support for the passive receive mode. So this library can't use them.


## AT firmware versions

This library requires esp8266 AT firmware 1.7.x. AT firmware 1.7.x is build on Espressif SDK 3.0.0. You can use the CheckFirmware sketch from examples Tools to check the version of the AT firmware. 

Version 2.0 of the esp8266 AT firmware can't be used with this library. It is different because it is based on ESP32 AT firmware and doesn't support passive receive mode.

Older 1.x versions of esp8266 AT firmware will work with this library, except of receiving data with WiFiClient.

The Espressif AT binary is built for 2MB-c1 flash partitioning. Flash Download Tool corrects it for 4 MB flash, but for esptool you must use the `--flash_size 2MB-c1` option and the corresponding addresses. (It works for 1 MB module too.)

```
esptool.py write_flash --flash_size 2MB-c1 0x0 boot_v1.7.bin 0x01000 at/1024+1024/user1.2048.new.5.bin 0x1fb000 blank.bin 0x1fc000 esp_init_data_default_v08.bin 0xfe000 blank.bin 0x1fe000 blank.bin
```

GitHub user loboris (Boris Lovosevic) builds customized versions of AT firmware with SDK 3 for all flash sizes. You can download the files from his [ESP8266_AT_LoBo GitHub repository](https://github.com/loboris/ESP8266_AT_LoBo).

AT firmware resources:
* [the Espressif binaries](https://www.espressif.com/en/support/download/at?keys=&field_type_tid%5B%5D=14) - only AT version 1.7 is good for this library
* [AT reference](https://www.espressif.com/en/support/download/overview?keys=AT+Instruction+Set&field_type_tid%5B%5D=14) - it contains firmware flashing instructions too
* [Flash Download Tool](https://www.espressif.com/en/support/download/other-tools?keys=&field_type_tid%5B%5D=14) It is Windows only, but can detect settings of your esp8266 and apply them to the flashed settings binary
* [esptool.py installation instructions](https://github.com/espressif/esptool#installation--dependencies)
* [AT LoBo flashing instructions](https://github.com/loboris/ESP8266_AT_LoBo/#flashing). First install esptool.py. If you download the AT LoBo repository as zip, it contains the firmware binaries and a script to flash them.


## Wiring of esp8266 module

The examples of this library expect the esp8266 RX/TX wired to hardware Serial1 for boards with Serial1. For AVR boards without Serial1 the examples setup SoftwareSerial on pins 6 (RX) and 7 (TX). Wire RX to TX.

To use hardware reset instead of software reset, wire selected pin of Arduino to reset pin of the esp8266 and set the pin as second parameter in WiFi.init(Serial1, ESP_RESET_PIN);. No logic level conversion is required for this connection. The library only sets the pin LOW or floating.

You can use the SerialPassthrough sketch from WiFiEspAT/Tools in IDE Example menu to bridge the esp8266 to computer over Arduino with the above wiring. You can then send AT commands to the AT firmware from the Serial Monitor. It is even possible to upload AT firmware if the esp8266 is on hardware Serial. Only put the esp8266 in flashing mode and set the upload baud rate to 115200 baud.


## Baud rate for communication with AT firmware

Over hardware Serial this library works reliably with AT firmware's default 115200 baud. With SoftwareSerial, 9600 baud must be used because of limitations of SoftwareSerial. You can try alternative software Serial libraries with their recommended baud rates. The ChangeBaudRate sketch in examples Tools section can change over SoftwareSerial the default baud rate of AT firmware from 115200 to 9600 baud. 

For hardware serial high baud rates can be used. For Arduino Mega 500000 baud works good. The ChangeBaudRate sketch can be used to change the default baud rate of the AT firmware to a higher one for hardware Serial. For example a WebServer serving web files from SD card requires high baud rate to be able to serve multiple files one after other fast enough.


## Persistent WiFi connection

The esp8266 can remember the WiFi network settings to connect automatically to WiFi network after power-up or reset. This library supports this with the SetupWiFiConnection example tool sketch. The sketch uses the WiFi.setPersistent() and WiFi.setAutoConnect() setting. After the connection is successful, it is remembered by the esp8266. Other sketches don't need to call WiFi.begin(), only wait until WiFi.status() returns WL_CONNECTED.

Using persistent connections has two benefits. The sketch size is smaller without WiFi.begin() and the connection to network is asynchronous, it happens while other devices are setup in setup(). (Synchronous WiFi.begin() with DHCP waits 5 seconds for the OK from AT firmware.)

WiFi.disconnect() clears the remembered connection and disables automatic connection to network. Don't use WiFi.setPersistent() and WiFi.disconnect() in the same sketch. The settings would be written to flash and then cleared repeatedly, which would lead to faster esp8266 flash memory wearing.

Without WiFi.setAutoConnect(true) the remembered network settings are not used (default is true until first disconnect()). If esp8266 auto starts the connection, it can collide with WiFi.begin(). Clear the persistent connection with WiFi.disconnect() before using a temporary connection.


## Persistent Access Point

This library supports esp8266 SoftAP control over AT firmware. With WiFi.beginAP() the SoftAP is started with default settings. Default settings are factory settings or remembered persistent settings. The SetupPeristentAP example tool can be used to setup SoftAP with custom SSID and optionally setup encryption/password and IP address for the SoftAP.

Use WiFi.endAP(true) to disable start of SoftAP at esp8266 startup. It will not clear the persistent AP settings.


## Enhanced WiFi API

This library implements Arduino WiFi networking API. The last version of this API is defined by the [Arduino WiFiNINA library](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/WiFiNINA). The WiFiEspAT library has some differences.

### the WiFi object differences

* `init` command to set the Serial interface used for communication
* `setPersistent` to set the remembering of the following WiFi connection (see the SetupPersistentWiFiConnection.ino tool example)
* `setAutoConnect` to set the automatic connection to remembered WiFi AP (see the SetupPersistentWiFiConnection.ino tool example)
* `scanNetworks` optionally can be called with array of type `WiFiApData[]` to fill
* `SSID` optionally can be called with char array to fill (see PrintPersistentSettings.ino tool example)
* `dhcpIsEnabled` to determine if DHCP or static IP is used (see PrintPersistentSettings.ino tool example)
* `beginAP` can be called without parameters to start the persistent AP (see ConfigurationAP.ino example)
* `endAP` - stops the AP. `endAP(true)` stops the AP and disables start of persistent AP at startup
* `configureAP` - to configure AP. see the SetupPersistentAP.ino tool example
* AP parameters getters - apMacAddress, apSSID, apPassphrase, apEncryptionType, apMaxConnections, apIsHidden, apDhcpIsEnabled, apIP, apGatewayIP, apSubnetMask (see PrintPersistentSettings.ino tool example)
* `startMDNS` to execute AT+MDNS. refer to AT reference for parameters
* `sntp` - to enable and configure SNTP time zone and servers. see SNTPTime.ino example
* `reset` - to reset or wake-up the esp8266. see DeepSleepAndHwReset.ino example
* `deepSleep`- to turn-off the esp8266. see DeepSleepAndHwReset.ino example
* `ping` doesn't have the ttl parameter and returns only true or false

### the WiFiClient class differences

* `connectSSL` is not implemented. It will be implemented as soon the AT firmware supports passive mode for SSL connection.
* `abort` closes the TCP connection without waiting for the remote side 

### the WiFiServer class differences

The WiFiServer class in this library doesn't derive from the Arduino Server class. It doesn't implement the never used 'send to all clients' functionality over Print class methods (print, write).

The AT firmware supports only one TCP server.

* `begin` has optional parameters maxConnCount (default 1) and serverTimeout in seconds (default 60)
* `end` to stop the server (the Arduino WiFi libraries can't stop a server)
* `accept` like in new [Ethernet library](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/EthernetServerAccept). see the AdvancedChatServer  

### the UDP differences

The Arduino UDP API requires to start a listening port to send an UDP message. This library doesn't require udp.begin() before udp.beginPacket(). 

You can use WiFiUdpSender class if you only send messages. See the UdpSender.ino example.

* `beginMulticast` is not implemented

## Logging

The EspAtDrv in center of the library has four logging levels to troubleshoot communication with AT firmware or help with development of new functions. At default logging is off, set to SILENT level.

Logging level and logging Serial instance, can be changed in src/utils/EspAtDrvLogging.h. Level DEBUG will print all AT commands and responses from AT firmware. Level ERROR will print only errors in communication with AT firmware. Higher logging level result in larger sketch size.


## Sketch size optimization

For small MCU like the ATmega328p on Uno, the sketch size matters. With modern compiler and linker almost all not used code is removed. So any additional function used in sketch results in larger sketch. Any function called to get information about the WiFi connection only to print a fancy welcome message adds to sketch size. 

With persistent WiFi connection WiFi.begin() and underlying functions are not used, resulting in smaller sketch size.

Use WiFiUdpSender class if you only send UDP messages. WiFiUDP always allocates the receive buffer.


## Advanced use

### Buffering and buffers

This library has small buffers in WiFiClient to achieve better performance over UART and over network. The size of the buffers is configured in WiFiEspAtConfig.h file in library's src folder. There is a special set of settings for AVR MCU with small SRAM. For small SRAM, the RX and TX buffer are 32 bytes, for all other it is 64 bytes.

For UDP to hold the composed message and the received message 64 bytes buffers are used for small AVR MCU and 256 bytes buffers for other MCU. 

It is recommended to use WiFiClient.flush() after completing the output. WiFiClient.stop() and WiFiUdp.endPacket() both call flush(). The library calls flush() if TX buffer is not empty and available() is called.

The buffers size can be changed in WiFiEspAtConfig.h or set on build command line. The TCP TX buffer can be set to 0 and the RX buffer must be at least 1 (for peek()), but then please use buffers in sketch for example with [StreamLib's](https://github.com/jandrassy/StreamLib) wrapper class BufferedPrint. 

The size of the UDP TX buffer can be set to zero in WiFiEspAtConfig.h if the complete message is sent with one print(msg) or one write(msg, length). Otherwise the size of the UDP buffers limits the size of the message. If the composed message is larger then the buffer it will be send as partial UDP messages. If the size of received message is larger then the UDP TX buffer, the message will be dropped (with WiFi.getLastDriverError() set to EspAtDrvError::UDP_LARGE).

To set different custom sizes of buffers for different boards, you can create a file boards.local.txt next to boards.txt file in hardware package. Set build.extra_flags for individual boards. For example for Mega you can add to boards.local.txt a line with -D options to define the macros.

mega.build.extra_flags=-DWIFIESPAT_TCP_RX_BUFFER_SIZE=128 -DWIFIESPAT_TCP_TX_BUFFER_SIZE=128


### EspAtDrv Errors

The library functions with bool as return type return false in case of fail. The functions which return a value return 0 or - 1 in case of error, depending on the semantic of the function. To get the reason of the error the sketch can test the WiFi.getLastDriverError(). The error codes are enumerated in util/EspAtDrvTypes.h.

For some functions 0 or false as returned value can have a meaning of error or be a valid return value. For example if you call `readBytes`, which has unsigned return type, without previously testing if bytes are available, then returned 0 can have the meaning of no bytes available or error occurred.

### UART Flow Control

The AT firmware sends notifications about different events without the host requesting them. Examples of this events are if data arrive for a connection or connection is closed. Without flow control of Serial interface some of this events can get lost in buffer overflow if they arrive in bulk. As compensation for lost events, the WiFiEspAT library polls the state of the connections. This adds to time spent in library functions.

If you can setup for the WiFiEspAT library a Serial connection with flow control, you can uncomment `#define ESPATDRV_ASSUME_FLOW_CONTROL` in EspAtDrv.cpp or define ESPATDRV_ASSUME_FLOW_CONTROL in boards.local.txt for the board. This will remove the polling of connections state.

The SerialPassthrough sketch from WiFiEspAT/Tools in IDE Example menu has optional configuration of SAMD SERCOM3 to create 'Serial' interface with flow control. The esp8266 CTS pin is pin 13. The example has pin 2 of MKRZERO as RTS pin. To activate flow control on the AT firmware side, use the AT+UART command with last parameter 2 or 3.
